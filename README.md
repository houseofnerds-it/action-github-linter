      - '.github/workflows/**'

jobs:
  linter:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      # needed for the checkout action

### Actions Skeleton
This template was forked from [CodelyTV/bash-github_actions-skeleton](https://github.com/CodelyTV/bash-github_actions-skeleton). I just changed the basic parameters, you can find my skeleton in [houseofnerds-it/actions-template](https://github.com/houseofnerds-it/actions-template).

### Github Linter
The Linter is a docker container from [rhysd/actionlint](https://github.com/rhysd/actionlint), so all credits go to them. I just made the github actions wrapper.
